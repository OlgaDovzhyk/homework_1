                <h1>Katniss Everdeen</h1>
                <p>A small town girl from District 12 who survived <a href="https://subtitry.su/2837-golodnye-igry.html"
                                                                      target="_blank" title="Part 1">The Hunger
                    Games</a> and
                    turned a
                    nation of slaves
                    into an army! Katniss
                    has strong and independent survivalist instincts due to her difficult past and is good at thinking
                    outside
                    the box. She is not socially adept and has a hard time making friends due to the emotional strain on
                    her
                    life which
                    has made her hard and cold. She is more concerned about feeding her family than being social, making
                    her
                    awkward
                    around people. Though Katniss can be rather blunt, misanthropic, sarcastic, bitingly cynical, and
                    cold, she
                    has a
                    very vulnerable side which she only shows around her family, and she has a natural maternal instinct
                    as
                    showed when
                    she comforted Prim and helped Rue. She is usually very logical except for times when her emotions
                    get in the
                    way.</p>

            â€•Katniss, to Coin</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span>Master Marksman:</span> Katniss is a highly skilled archer and hunter, which she learned from her
                father. She could
                draw an arrow and strike several targets with a good amount of speed and flexibility due to her good
                reflexes.
                She uses her reflexes several times throughout the trilogy: When escaping the Cornucopia bloodbath in
                the <a

                        title="The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1">74th
                    Hunger Games</a>, evading fireballs when the Gamemakers create a forest inferno to draw the tributes
                together, when
                she ran from the wolf mutts, fighting Cato atop the Cornucopia, escaping the monkey mutts during the
                third
                Quarter Quell and then diverting her aim at the end of the book to assassinate President Coin. Later in
                District
                13, she belatedly undergoes military training in order to participate in the fighting against the
                Capitol and
                gains enough proficiency with a gun to be selected for a sharpshooter unit, <a
                        href="https://subtitry.su/2835-golodnye-igry-soyka-peresmeshnica-chast-ii.html" target="_blank"

                    451</a>. In pre-judging, she
                scored the highest mark out of all tributes which was an 11. In the <a
                        href="https://subtitry.su/2836-golodnye-igry-i-vspyhnet-plamya.html" target="_blank"
                        title="The Hunger Games: Catching Fire">second movie</a>,
                she demonstrated exceptional
                lethality during her combat simulation, which all the other tributes watched in awe.
            </li>
            <li><span>Knife Proficiency:</span> She has some experience with wielding and throwing a knife in order to
                finish off a wounded
                prey animal. During practice sessions, she found that she was also a reasonably good spear-thrower,
                indicating
                she has skill with most- if not all- projectile weapons.
            </li>
            <li><span>Skilled Combatant:</span> Before the third quarter quell, Peeta trains Katniss hand to hand combat
                skills, making her
                an exceptional opponent. She is also trained further while living in District 13.
            </li>
            <li><span>Gifted Intellect:</span> She is a very clever woman and a quick learner. She possessed the ability
                to quickly process
                multiple information streams and rapidly respond to changing tactical situations. After meeting Gale and
                learning from her, she added fishing and trapping to her skills. Also, she was making snares in the
                Training
                Center while watching the training of the career tributes including Cato using a sword, Glimmer using
                Bow and
                Arrows, and Marvel using and throwing spears, in order to analyse their abilities. She had to educate
                herself on
                the edible, medicinal, and poisonous plant life of District 12. Hunting and gathering on a daily basis
                have
                given her a highly skilled sense of woodcraft. Moreover, Katniss is a skilled tree-climber and a fast
                runner,
                which has benefited her in hunting and the Games.
            </li>
            <li><span>Singer:</span> She has a good singing voice, also inherited from her father, although she was
                reluctant to sing since
                his death.
